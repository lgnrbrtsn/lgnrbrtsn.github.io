          <h2>A FEW BOOKS BY HUMANS ABOUT BEING HUMAN</h2>
          <p>This site represents a simple project to document and share a few books that have helped me understand myself and the world.</p>
          <p>I've begun with the book <a href="https://booksbyhumans.net/hessert/hessert.html">Christ and the End of Meaning</a> by Paul Hessert. Other books will follow as I have time to add them here.</p>
          <p>The project is an effort to try to understand the books listed on this site, and to do it in public, with the hopes that others may become interested enough in the books covered here to go read them.</p>
          <p>Each book gets a page with a short summary. Beyond that each chapter gets a page with an extended outline. I hope that these outlines will aid those who undertake to study the books, including myself.</p>
